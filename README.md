# Crime-Data-Analysis
This repository contains the code, datasets, and outputs for a data science project aimed at predicting and preventing crimes using machine learning models and exploratory data analysis.

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze crime data, identify trends, and predict occurrences to support informed decision-making for crime prevention. The project combines data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.

# Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of crime datasets.
- Exploratory data analysis using R and Python.
- Implementation and tuning of machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Bagging.
- Creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard for data visualization.

# File Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:

**Dataset:** 
- `S1File.xlsx`: Crime occurrence reports, demographic, housing, economic, and education datasets.

**Code files:**
- `Data Engineering and Cleaning,ipynb`: Python file for data cleaning
- `EDA in R.Rmd`: EDA done in R 
- `EDA in R.html`: EDA output in html format
- `Modeling_EDA.html`: Modeling output in html format
- `Modeling_EDA.ipynb`: Modeling code in python.

# Results
- The best-performing model is the Bagging ensemble (Random Forest + SVM) with an RMSE of 117 and r-squared of 0.78.
- Classification accuracy of 95% achieved using a hyper-tuned Random Forest model.
